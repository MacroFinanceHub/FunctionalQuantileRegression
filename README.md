# Functional Quantile Regression

A method to perform Bayesian functional quantile regression. The proposed method is applicable to data sets given the _N_ by _T_ matrix of response functions _Y_ and _N_ by _p_ design matrix _X_ for functional quantile regression. 

This repository provides 
- a set of MATLAB scripts to implement our proposed Bayesian Functional Quantile Regression model and the na√Øve Bayesian Quantile Regression; 
- R scripts to implement the bootstrap-based approaches which were compared to our proposed model in the paper; 
- the code to reproduce all the figures in the manuscript and the supplementary
- the code to adjust for block effects from the preprocessed mass spectrometry data and to generate the simulation datasets


Please refer to ```readme_data_and_code_description.docx``` for 
- instructions of how to reproduce results in the paper including both simulations and real data application 
- descriptions of the real data
